Twilight Forest - 1.12.2 - Mist Wolf Edition
==============

This is a modified version of the 1.12.2 Twilight Forest build, which is a branch that no longer accepts new features.

The original version can be found at the [Twilight Forest GitHub](https://github.com/TeamTwilight/twilightforest/tree/1.12.x).

## New Features
- **Mist Wolf Taming** - Mist wolves can now be tamed. This requires the player to hold a scepter in their off-hand while having bones held in their main hand. The mist wolf will only accept the bones when it doesn't have an attack target, which will most likely require the player to build a taming enclosure. Note that successfully taming a mist wolf requires significantly more bones than it would with a normal wolf. The taming process is intended to be its own project.

- **Intelligent Teleporting** - The increased size of the mist wolf required more intelligent teleportation when following the player, to prevent the mist wolf from suffocating in blocks or going long periods of time without being able to teleport. One example of this improvement is the mist wolf's ability to teleport into space occupied by grass, flowers, and torches, whereas a normal wolf cannot.

- **New Behavioral Mode** - When a mist wolf is tamed, the owner can issue them an order to guard the area, causing the mist wolf to wander the area they're in and making them hostile to other players. This mode can be initiated by right-clicking the mist wolf with an empty hand while sneaking. This mode can be ended by making the mist wolf sit.

- **Peaceful Mist Wolves** - Mist wolves have been updated to remain present in peaceful worlds, to stay consistent with other tameable animals. When untamed, they follow players around peacefully.

- **Growth Teleport Fixed** - Vanilla Minecraft had a bug in 1.12 which caused sitting baby wolves to teleport to their owner when they became an adult. This carried over to mist wolves, but has been fixed.

- **Stat Updates** - When tamed, a mist wolf's health and attack are reduced to that of a normal tamed wolf. Additionally, vanilla Minecraft would not change the current health of wolves when adjusting their max health, which caused them to whine. This has been fixed for mist wolves.

- **Better Interactions** - Various ways of interacting with mist wolves have been improved. As an example, attempting to feed mist wolves meat will not cause them to sit, even when the mist wolf won't accept meat. These changes are aimed at keeping mist wolves in their desired behavioral state, so common actions won't accidentally modify their behavior.

- **Mist Wolf Self-Defense** - When another player attempts to do something that would directly affect your mist wolf, such as renaming them with a name tag, dyeing their collar, or putting them in love mode, the mist wolf will growl at them, preventing the action from taking place.
